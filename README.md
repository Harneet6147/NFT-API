# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

This CRUD Api allows users to create, read, update and delete the NFTS.
This application uses a server developed in express which is integrated with a solidity file through etherjs to store data on the blockchain.
Also I have used hardhat.
